<!--
  GOAL OF THIS CONFIGURATION IS TO CUSTOMIZE THE genericskel.plone3buildout paster template options to fit to your needs
  You can even override by copy/edit it on your ~/.genericskel.plone3.xml.
  Goal is to stop to spread new templates for special use, and to configure them.
  A subsidiary goal is to remove so useless logic in templates.
  You can, i think, customzize the whole template via this configuration.
  Please note that genericskel.plone3buildout is coupled with collectige.generic.skel.* templates.
  They will use it's variables/API to construct themselves.
